# clevercmd

CleverCMD is a command line utility to chat with cleverbot.com.<br>
Its a little side project, but it's fun to play with.<br>
I just created it for fun, so don't expect too much.<br>

<br>

## How to use

Just run the following command in your terminal (requires Node.js to be installed):

```
npx clevercmd
```

<br>

### Thanks

Thank you to [@IntriguingTiles](https://github.com/IntriguingTiles) for creating [cleverbot-free](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cleverbot-free) which I used to communicate with the cleverbot API.
